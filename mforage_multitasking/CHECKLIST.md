# CHECKLIST

1. what targets should we use in the working memory task (https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13423-021-01903-2 and https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027722003079)
2. need instructions for working memory task?
3. how many trials for working memory task?
4. working memory task - 3 locations or 2?
5. is the working memory task spatial enough? or too dependent on the identities? I am translating them into an order (will explain what I mean)
6. which keys to use to make 'same' or 'different' responses on the memory task? how to randomise/counterbalance across participants?
7. Break info/messages?
8. Enough trials between memory probes (in the dual task condition)? or too many?
9. I have added a period before the memory targets come on (750 msec-ish, to split
it apart from when just preceded by a memory probe. Good idea or bad idea?
10. Check that each context is associated only with memory targets from the other
context, or from 4 locations that belong to neither context (which is uniquely associated with
that context).
11. Stage 3 - need to change it so that blocks don't intervene between memory display/probes
12. Should we have alternating green/purple task blocks, or keep it separate? or have a screen to 
say you are switching between the tasks?
13. Are targets on for too long during the search task?
