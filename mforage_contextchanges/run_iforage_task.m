% Dimensions calibrated for 530 mm x 300 mm ASUS VG248 monitor (with viewing distance

% Task is a visual search/foraging task. Participants seek the target which
% is randomly placed behind 1 of 16 doors. There are two contexts to learn
% within each session (2 sessions in total) - 
% with 4 doors in each display being allocated p=.25
% Rate of switches between contexts depends on stage and condition
