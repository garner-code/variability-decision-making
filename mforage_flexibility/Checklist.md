# Checklist

## Things for Shailey and Caleb to give feedback on

1. Is the target on for long enough/not long enough? (I find it disruptive and wonder if it could be on for a shorter period of time).
2. Instructions - good as they are, or should we change them?
3. How long do all the tasks take to run? Do we need a shorter practice phase? can we afford a longer practice phase?
4. Please run a random set of subject numbers and check that colour -> door set mappings are consistent through every stage of the task.
5. Thoughts/feedback on how habity you get in the slow switch stage with the colour cues.
