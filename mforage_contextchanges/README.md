# Notes on counterbalancing for the doors task

## Pre-run through notes:
- check sub_infos.m matrix is done - 
- points screen at the end
- counterbalancing 23 -- 1 - transfer A, 2 - transfer B
- countrebalancing 23 -- 1 - context a first in test, 2 = context b first in test
- counterbalancing 24 -- 1 - complete transfer 1st, 2 - hybrid transfer first
- do I need to add a counterbalancing for which context goes first in the switching (no, randomised)


## recent changes
- low switch group is now .95/.05 p

## to-do
- need to sort feedback - trial by trial
- need to sort shade out for no press period
- add instructions/images etc
- code to fully sanity check tranfer learning counterbalancing
- final selection screens for learning stage
