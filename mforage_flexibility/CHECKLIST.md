# CHECKLIST

## Things for Shailey and Caleb to give feedback on

1. Is the target on for long enough/not long enough? Is now 350 ms. Is that better?
2. How long does the whole session take to run? Do we need a shorter training phase? can we afford a longer training phase? Pilot 5 niave people.
3. Please run a random set of subject numbers and check that colour -> door set mappings are consistent through every stage of the task. 
4. Thoughts/feedback on how habity you get in the slow switch stage with the colour cues.
5. Points: when running yourself and the 5, need to check how many points everyone earned, to get an idea of a best case scenario. Then need to design a points to badges system or similar. Something achievable, but that requires good performance to work towards.
6. Visual aesthetics - any colour changes to display?
7. fill in details in comments when PCs chosen
