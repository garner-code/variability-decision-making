# Notes on counterbalancing for the doors task

## Pre-run through notes:
- We need a list of all the different counterbalancing options

## Instructions
- what are the instructions going to be? (do we need to find appropriate targets?)
- do we need them between context switches in learn and learning transfer stages?

## Things to double/triple check
- That for all the counterbalancing types, the mapping of colour to target doors is consistent!!!!
- What should we do for counterbalancing the hybrid transfer locations?
- What do you think to no-waity target during the task-switching phase?
- What do we think of p=.6/.4 for task switching and p=.7/.3 for training?
