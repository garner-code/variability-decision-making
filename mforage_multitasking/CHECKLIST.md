# CHECKLIST

**Weeks 5-7**
1. put targets together for working memory task - 4 categories of animals - each folder contains 50 images of same aspect ratio, resolution etc, with the animal taking up comparable amounts of foreground across all the images. **Must** be labelled consistently - e.g.  tgt01.jpg, tgt02.jpg etc
2. Instructions for working memory task
3. Instructions for remaining task phases (compare with Shaily)
4. working memory task - 4 locations
5. Write/decide on break info messages
6. Collect data from 8-10 participants (very short task, won't take too long)

**Puns**
'Seems like you really have a ‘handle’ on this door situation!'
'What do you call a cat who’s also a professional golfer? Tiger Woods'
'What do animals use to count? A cowculator'
'You’re doing an otter-ly terrific job'
'Aren’t puppies just a-door-able? '
'Gryffin-door – our task’s spirit animal'
'What do bears do in winter? Hy-bear-nate'
'Paw-some work!'



**After week 7**
7. Enough trials between memory probes (in the dual task condition)? or too many? - double
8. I have added a period before the memory targets come on (750 msec-ish, to split
it apart from when just preceded by a memory probe. Good idea or bad idea?
9. Check that each context is associated only with memory targets from the other
context, or from 4 locations that belong to neither context (which is uniquely associated with
that context).
10. Stage 3 - need to change it so that blocks don't intervene between memory display/probes
11. Should we have alternating green/purple task blocks, or keep it separate? or have a screen to 
say you are switching between the tasks?
12. Are targets on for too long during the search task?
