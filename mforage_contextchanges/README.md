# Notes on counterbalancing for the doors task

## Pre-run through notes:
- We need a list of all the different counterbalancing options
- Should we randomise the door->task allocations rather than counterbalancing?

## Instructions
- what are the instructions going to be? (do we need to find appropriate targets?)
- do we need them between context switches in learn and learning transfer stages?

## Things to double/triple check
- That for all the counterbalancing types, the mapping of colour to target doors is consistent!!!!
- What should we do for counterbalancing the hybrid transfer locations?
- What do you think to no-waity target during the task-switching phase?
- What do we think of p=.6/.4 for task switching and p=.7/.3 for training?
- I think we should put time pressure on the task switching, and potentially, learning transfer stage
- More sensitive dv for task switching? e.g. duration until 1st context relevant door pressed after context cue?
- 2nd more sensitive dv - duration spent on (and pressed) doors from irrelevant context after context cue.
- Should mixed transfer be 3 from 1, and either 1 from the other or 1 random?
